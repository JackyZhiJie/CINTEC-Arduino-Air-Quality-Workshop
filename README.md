# Arduino Project - PM2.5 Environmental Monitoring

## 💡CINTEC Arduino Sustainabilty Workshop Materials
This STEM workshop was designed and conducted by me at CUHK's Centre for Innovation and Technology (CINTEC). The educational repository contains comprehensive STEM workshop focusing on environmental monitoring and Arduino programming, designed to teach secondary school students about air pollution through hands-on experimentation with **PM2.5 sensors**.

## 📝 Workshop Overview
This repository contains materials for an air quality monitoring workshop that introduces:
* Basic Arduino programming and circuit building
* DSM501A sensor implementation for PM2.5 detection
* Environmental science concepts and air pollution monitoring
* Practical applications of PPM measurements

**Note: This workshop material was first successfully implemented at CUHK in April 2023 for the Hong Kong Science Festival and was repeated in April 2024 (not for the Hong Kong Science Festival but as a STEM workshop still held at CUHK). It has received positive feedback from secondary school students and teachers.**
